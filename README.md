[PharmPath Scenarios - Access here](https://pharmpath.itch.io/pharmpath-scenarios)

These 3 virtual case-based scenarios will provide students with a learning opportunity reflective of three current practice examples based in a community pharmacy setting. The cases are grounded in common professional competencies for Registered Pharmacists (RPh) and Pharmacy Technicians (RPhT) and are designed to promote intra-professional role understanding and collaborative practice. 

Developed using Unity game engine and Blender for 3D animation.
